Also look at adding norsk dvorak for learning norwegian - also dvorak alternative for swedish too (definitely worth spending time in)

Look into making a heuristics-based keyboard layout modifier:
    add heuristics for limiting the position of j cannot be above k for example.
    with clever structure should be able to make it really quick
    potentially add preferences as well - prefer for navigation (hjkl) to be on the right hand

    heuristics:
        
        j cannot be above k
        h must be to left of l
